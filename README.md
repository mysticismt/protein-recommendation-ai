An advanced Machine Learning and Bio-Statistical pipeline that predicts personalized daily protein requirements. By integrating real federal **NHANES** anthropometric and lifestyle data with simulated genetic scores and clinical biochemistry parameters, this project delivers a highly accurate predictive model ($R^2 = 0.9815$).

## 🎯 Key Features
* **Advanced Feature Engineering:** Synthesized a multi-factor **Genetic Score (GS)** and dynamic **Physical Activity Score (PAS)** based on real epidemiological assumptions.
* **Biochemical Integration:** Incorporated key biomarkers (Albumin, Blood Urea Nitrogen, etc.) to tailor metabolic protein efficiency.
* **High-Precision Regressor:** Deployed a tuned Multiple Linear Regression model achieving exceptional predictive power.
* **Production-Ready Architecture:** Clean, modularized Python scripts separating Data Ingestion, Feature Engineering, and Model Training.

## 📊 Model Performance

The regressor was evaluated on a comprehensive test split, demonstrating robust generalization with virtually zero overfitting:

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **R-squared ($R^2$)** | **0.9815** |
| **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** | **1.5034 grams** |
| **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** | **1.9422 grams** |

> **Note:** The extremely high $R^2$ score reflects the deterministic nature of the synthesized physiological formula combined with the linear alignment of NHANES anthropometric baselines.

## 📊 Dataset Methodology
This project leverages real-world anthropometric and biochemical baselines from the NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) dataset. To enable personalized modeling, synthetic Genetic Influences and targeted Protein Requirements were engineered into the pipeline based on established epidemiological distributions and published clinical nutrition guidelines.
